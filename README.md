# Sign Language Classifier
The classifier made up of three convolutional neural network layers, and one fully connected layer.
it's usage is to classify between the 32 signs in arabic sign language alphabet.

To run the arabic sign languange classifier, type: 
*python hand_sign_classifier.py path-to-video-of-hand-signs* in the terminal.
It has a very good accuracy to gestures that is similar to the data that it was trained on and to gestures that have a similar lighting conditions.
on the test split of the dataset it gets about 99%.
but when used to detect hand signs of a random conditions it has a barely working accuracy (maybe 50% or a little bit higher).


# Key pressing with hand sign
Similar to the sign language classifier, To run the hand-sign-to-keypress program, type: *python Keydetect.py path-to-video-of-recorded-hand-directions* in the terminal.
It has a very good accuracy provided that it has a decent lighting conditions.
If it detects a hand directed upwards it presses UP-key, and similar to that all the other three directions.
Specifically, the hand must be in the top left quarter of the video as the program is suited to detect hands in this position.

it can be used to scroll up or down when browsing without using mouse.




In order to make any of the programs work in realtime, change the line of *cap = cv.VideoCapture(sys.argv[1])* to *cap = cv.VideoCapture(0)*
and flip it if necessary
